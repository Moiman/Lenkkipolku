I want to plan my running path before running, so I don't run circles, discover new paths or run too far.

I want to measure lenght of my running path, so I could better plan time needed for running

I want to save my path, so I could view it later

I want to edit my path, so I could improve my path

I want to remove my path, so old paths don't clutter my list

I want organize my path list, so I can see most important path first.

I want to delete all my data, so I can keep my privacy
